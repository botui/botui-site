# Introduction

![logo](public/logo.svg)


## Welcome to BotUI documentation 👋🏼

BotUI makes it super easy to create conversational (bot) interfaces. It has an intuitive JavaScript API to add messages and show actions that a user can perform. It has a React package but Vue and other frameworks are also supported (you can easily intergrate it into your [insert-any-framework-name-here] project).
